# Maximum Moves in a Grid

This C++ code calculates the maximum number of moves that can be performed in a grid. You can start at any cell in the first column of the matrix and traverse the grid in a way that allows movement to cells with values strictly greater than the current cell's value.

## Code Explanation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Function to calculate the maximum moves in a grid
int maxMoves(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();

    // Initialize a 2D DP array to store the maximum moves from each cell
    vector<vector<int> > dp(m, vector<int>(n, 0));

    // Initialize DP array with 1 for the first column
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        dp[i][0] = 1;
    }

    // Iterate through the grid to update the DP array
    for (int col = 1; col < n; col++) {
        for (int row = 0; row < m; row++) {
            for (int dRow : {-1, 0, 1}) {
                int newRow = row + dRow;
                if (newRow >= 0 && newRow < m && grid[newRow][col - 1] < grid[row][col]) {
                    dp[row][col] = max(dp[row][col], dp[newRow][col - 1] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Find the maximum moves in the last column
    int maxMoves = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        maxMoves = max(maxMoves, dp[i][n - 1]);
    }

    return maxMoves;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> grid1 = {{2, 4, 3, 5}, {5, 4, 9, 3}, {3, 4, 2, 11}, {10, 9, 13, 15}};
    vector<vector<int>> grid2 = {{3, 2, 4}, {2, 1, 9}, {1, 1, 7}};

    // Calculate and print the maximum moves for the given grids
    cout << "Maximum moves for grid1: " << maxMoves(grid1) << endl; // Output: 3
    cout << "Maximum moves for grid2: " << maxMoves(grid2) << endl; // Output: 0

    return 0;
}
```

# How it Works

The code defines a function maxMoves that calculates the maximum number of moves in a given grid using dynamic programming.

In the main function, two example grids (grid1 and grid2) are provided, and the maxMoves function is called to calculate the maximum moves for each grid.

The maxMoves function initializes a 2D DP array to store the maximum moves from each cell in the grid. It starts by setting the first column's values to 1.

The function then iterates through the grid to update the DP array based on the adjacent cells' values in the previous column.

Finally, it finds and returns the maximum number of moves from the last column, which is the answer to the problem.

In the main function, the results for both grids are printed to the console.

Feel free to use this code to calculate the maximum moves in any given grid. Enjoy exploring and solving problems with dynamic programming! ðŸš€
